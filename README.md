## Predicting Recruitment Rate (RR) in Clinical Trials
This project focuses on developing a predictive framework to estimate Recruitment Rate (RR) in clinical trials, aiding benchmarking and strategic planning. The dataset includes 20,676 clinical trial records with 29 features, such as study status, enrollment size, and intervention types. Using machine learning models like Linear Regression and Random Forest, the framework integrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation. Random Forest performed best with an RMSE of 127.52 and an RÂ² of 0.01. The project includes a fully deployable pipeline, enabling real-world predictions. For setup, clone the repository, install dependencies, and execute the script after updating the dataset path. The trained model is saved as clinical_trial_rr_model.pkl for easy reuse in prediction tasks.
